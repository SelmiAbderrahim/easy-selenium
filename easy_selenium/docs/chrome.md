## Usage

```

from easy_selenium.driver.chrome.driver import Driver
driver = Driver()
chrome = driver.create()

chrome.get("https://selmi.tech")

```

## Options

**Load Profile**

Launch Chrome with its default or custom profile so that you can use cookies and site preferences from that profile.

```
chrome = driver.create_driver(profile="")
```

Note: Make sure to provide the absolute path of your profile and if the given profile folder doesn't exist, it'll be created.

To find path to your chrome profile data you need to type chrome://version/ into address bar .

**Headless**

We can use a headless chrome browser to lower memory overhead and faster execution for the scripts that we write.

```
chrome = driver.create_driver(headless=False)
```
